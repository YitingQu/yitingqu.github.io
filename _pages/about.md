I am currently a second-year Ph.D. student at [CISPA Helmholtz Center for Information Security](https://cispa.de/en), co-supervised by [Prof. Michael Backes](https://cispa.de/en/about/director-page) and [Prof. Yang Zhang](https://yangzhangalmo.github.io/). Before that, I obtained my master's degree at Shanghai Jiao Tong University (2021) and obtained my bachelor's degree at Shandong University (2018).
